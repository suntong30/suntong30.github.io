Hi, I'm currently a 2nd year PhD student in the [College of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.zju.edu.cn/) at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn), and expected to get the PhD degree in 2027. I'm co-advised by  [Prof. Wei Dong（董玮）](https://dongw.emnets.cn/) and [Prof. Yi Gao（高艺）](https://person.zju.edu.cn/gaoyi). Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from the [School of Electronics and Information Engineering](https://elec.hdu.edu.cn/ele_en/main.htm) in [Hangzhou Dianzi University](https://en.hdu.edu.cn/main.htm), Hangzhou, 2022, advised by [Prof. Long Chen（陈龙）](https://elec.hdu.edu.cn/2017/1205/c1827a57681/page.htm). 

My research interests mainly focus on _IoT Security & System_, _Mobile OTA_, and _Deduplication_.
