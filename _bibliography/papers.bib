  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  title={dTEE: A Declarative Approach to Secure IoT Applications Using TrustZone},
  author={Sun, Tong and Li, Borui and Teng, Yixiao and Gao, Yi and Dong*, Wei},
  journal={Proc. of ACM/IEEE IPSN},
  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) applications have recently been widely used in safety-critical scenarios. To prevent sensitive information leaks, IoT device vendors provide hardware-assisted protections, called Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), like ARM TrustZone. Programming a TEE-based application requires separate code for two components, significantly slowing down the development process. Existing solutions tackle this issue by automatic code partition while not successfully applying it in two complicated scenarios: adding trusted logic and interactions with secure peripherals. We propose dTEE, a declarative approach to secure IoT applications based on TrustZone. dTEE proposes a rapid approach that enables developers to declare tiered-sensitive variables and functions of existing applications. Besides, dTEE automatically transforms device drivers into trusted ones. We evaluate dTEE on four real world IoT applications and seven micro-benchmarks. Results show that dTEE achieves high expressiveness for supporting 50% more applications than existing approaches and reduces 90% of the lines of code against handcrafted development.}
